--- need to do self join to get pairs
select a.X,a.Y from functions as a, functions as b
--- to get symmetric metrics below given condition is to be satisfied
where a.x = b.y and b.x = a.y
--- to remove duplicate values below method can be used
group by a.x,a.y
having count(*)>1 or a.x<a.y
--- as asked need to order by as below
order by a.x
